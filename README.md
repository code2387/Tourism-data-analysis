Visitors and Revenue Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about various tourist locations, focusing on their visitors, ratings, revenue, and accommodation availability. The goal is to uncover insights regarding how these factors interact across different categories such as Nature, Historical, Cultural, and Beach.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following key columns:

Location ID: Unique identifier for each location.
Country: Country where the location is situated.
Category: Classification of the location (e.g., Nature, Historical).
Visitors: Total number of visitors to the location.
Rating: Average rating of the location.
Revenue: Total revenue generated by the location.
Accommodation Available: Indicates if accommodation is available at the location (Yes/No).
Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved:

Handling missing values.
Ensuring data types are appropriate (e.g., converting numeric fields).
Removing duplicates or irrelevant entries, if any.
Basic Summary Statistics
We computed the following statistics:

Visitors: Total and average visitors per country/category.
Rating: Average, maximum, and minimum ratings per category or country.
Revenue: Total revenue and revenue per visitor for each location.
Accommodation Availability: Analysis of how accommodation impacts visitors, ratings, and revenue.
Visualizations
Multiple visualizations were created to illustrate key findings:

Bar Charts: Show total visitors or revenue per country or category.

Scatter Plots: Examine relationships, such as between visitors and ratings or revenue.

Line Plots: Display trends in visitors and revenue by category, distinguishing between locations with and without accommodation.

Visitors by Category with Accommodation Availability: Highlights the influence of accommodation on visitor numbers.
Revenue by Category with Accommodation Availability: Reveals how accommodation affects revenue generation.
Box and Violin Plots: Visualize the distribution of revenue and visitors across categories.

Count and Heatmap Plots: Provide insights into the number of locations per country/category and the correlation between numeric variables.

Facet Grids: Create multiple plots for each category or accommodation type for comparative analysis.

Insights
Impact of Accommodation: Locations that offer accommodation generally see higher visitor numbers and revenue, particularly in the Nature and Beach categories.
Visitor and Revenue Trends: Some categories attract more visitors but generate less revenue, while others achieve high revenue with fewer visitors, suggesting differences in spending habits.
Category Popularity: Certain categories are more popular, with higher visitors and revenue, which could guide investment and marketing strategies.
Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of visitor behavior, revenue generation, and the significance of accommodation availability across different tourist locations. The findings can inform strategic decisions aimed at enhancing visitor experience and optimizing revenue.
